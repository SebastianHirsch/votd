## Todo

* Generate an appropriate VOTD from a static file if there's any error communicating with the VOTD API. (suggest something like John 3:16).

* Update `votd` command-line version to. Currently only a bare stub of an app.

* Integrate [ESV API](http://www.esvapi.org/api)

* Ensure Ruby < 1.9 compatibility.
