## Todo

* Generate an appropriate VOTD from a static file if there's any error communicating with the VOTD API. (e.g. John 3:16)

* Update `votd` command-line version. Currently only a bare stub of an app.

* Integrate [ESV API](http://www.esvapi.org/api)

* Enable support for more translations from [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com/usage/votd/docs/)

* Ensure Ruby 1.8.7 compatibility.

* Add some kind of simple caching
