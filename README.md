# VotD - (Bible) Verse of the Day

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/doctorbh/votd.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/doctorbh/votd)

VotD (Verse of the Day) is a Ruby Gem that wraps various web services that generate
daily Bible Verses.


Currently the gem supports two VotD web services:

* [Bible.org](http://labs.bible.org) - NETBible Translation
* [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com) - NIV Translations (Currently only supporting the default NIV, but planning on adding more.)

Other services are are planned:

* [Bible Gateway](http://www.biblegateway.com) - More Translations
 
* [ESV Bible Web Service](http://www.esvapi.org/) - ESV Translation

If you are able to contribute modules for any of these, please see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/doctorbh/votd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Let us know before you begin work in case someone else has a module in-progress.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'votd'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install votd

## Usage

To use VotD in your code:

    require 'votd'
    
    votd = Votd.NetBible.new
    
    # or votd = Votd.BibleGateway.new
    
    votd.reference   # Ephesians 2:8-9
    votd.text        # For by grace you are saved through faith...
    votd.date        # 2012-03-24
    votd.version     # NIV
    votd.copyright   # Copyright Â© ...
    
    votd.to_html     # <p class="votd-text">For by grace you are saved through faith...
    
Full text of HTML formatted VotD looks like the following

    <p class="votd-text">For by grace you are saved through faith... it is not from works, so that no one can boast.</p>
    <p>
    <span class="votd-reference"><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong></span>
	<span class="votd-version"><em>(NETBible)</em></span>
	</p>

You can then use the provided CSS classes to style the VotD.

You may also provide custom HTML text by using the `custom_html` method with a block. **(currently only available in HEAD, not yet released)**
    
    votd.custom_html do |votd|
      "<p>#{votd.reference} - #{votd.text} (#{votd.version})</p>"
    end

    # votd.to_html now outputs:
    # <p>John 3:16 - For God so loved... (KJV)</p>
